# MATH LESSON PLAN: Quadratic Equations - Factoring Method

**Grade:** 9-10
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Date:** ___________

---

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to **solve quadratic equations by factoring** and verify their solutions using substitution.

## Prior Knowledge
Students should already know:
- How to factor trinomials (e.g., x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3))
- The Zero Product Property (if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0)

## Materials
- [ ] Whiteboard/markers
- [ ] Student notebooks
- [ ] Practice worksheet
- [ ] Calculator (optional)

## LESSON TIMELINE

### WARM-UP (5 minutes)
**Bell Ringer Problem:**
Factor the following expression: x² + 9x + 14

**Answer:** (x + 2)(x + 7)

### DIRECT INSTRUCTION (15 minutes)

**Key Concept:**
A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0. We can solve it by:
1. Factoring the left side
2. Using the Zero Product Property to find x values

**Formula/Rule:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Zero Product Property:                                 │
│  If (x + m)(x + n) = 0                                  │
│  Then x + m = 0  OR  x + n = 0                          │
│  Therefore: x = -m  OR  x = -n                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. Write the equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0)
2. Factor the quadratic expression completely
3. Set each factor equal to zero
4. Solve each linear equation for x
5. Check answers by substituting back into the original equation

**Worked Example 1:**
Problem: Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Solution:
- Step 1: Already in standard form ✓
- Step 2: Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
- Step 3: Set each factor = 0:
  - x + 2 = 0  →  x = -2
  - x + 3 = 0  →  x = -3
- Step 4: Check x = -2: (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
- **Answer: x = -2 or x = -3**

**Worked Example 2:**
Problem: Solve x² - 16 = 0

Solution:
- Step 1: Already in standard form ✓
- Step 2: Factor (difference of squares): (x + 4)(x - 4) = 0
- Step 3: x + 4 = 0  →  x = -4  |  x - 4 = 0  →  x = 4
- **Answer: x = -4 or x = 4**

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Forgetting to set the equation equal to zero before factoring
- Finding only one solution (most quadratics have TWO solutions)
- Sign errors: if (x + 3) = 0, then x = -3, not +3

### GUIDED PRACTICE (10 minutes)

**We Do Together:**

Problem 1: Solve x² + 8x + 15 = 0
- Factor: (x + 3)(x + 5) = 0
- x + 3 = 0 → x = -3
- x + 5 = 0 → x = -5
- **Solutions: x = -3, x = -5**

Problem 2: Solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0
- Factor: (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
- x - 3 = 0 → x = 3
- x - 4 = 0 → x = 4
- **Solutions: x = 3, x = 4**

---

### INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (12 minutes)

**You Do (Classwork):**

1. (Basic) x² + 6x + 8 = 0
2. (Basic) x² - 5x + 6 = 0
3. (Medium) x² + 2x - 15 = 0
4. (Medium) x² - 9x + 20 = 0
5. (Challenge) A rectangular garden has an area of 84 m². The length is 5 meters more than the width. Find the dimensions.

**Answer Key:**
1. x = -2, x = -4
2. x = 2, x = 3
3. x = 3, x = -5
4. x = 4, x = 5
5. Width = 7 m, Length = 12 m (from w² + 5w - 84 = 0, so w = 7)

---

### CLOSURE (3 minutes)

**Exit Ticket:**
Solve: x² - 3x - 10 = 0

**Answer:** x = 5, x = -2 (factors to (x - 5)(x + 2) = 0)

**Tomorrow's Preview:**
Tomorrow we'll learn the Quadratic Formula - a method that works even when equations can't be factored!

## DIFFERENTIATION

**Scaffolding (Struggling Students):**
- Provide a factor pair reference chart
- Give partially completed problems: x² + 7x + 10 = (x + __)(x + __)
- Allow use of multiplication table for finding factor pairs

**Extension (Advanced Students):**
- Solve: 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0 (leading coefficient ≠ 1)
- Create a word problem that results in a quadratic equation
- Explore: Can a quadratic equation have only ONE solution? When?

## HOMEWORK
1. x² + 10x + 21 = 0
2. x² - 8x + 15 = 0
3. x² - 25 = 0
4. x² + 4x - 32 = 0
5. The product of two consecutive positive integers is 72. Find the integers.

**Homework Answers:**
1. x = -3, x = -7
2. x = 3, x = 5
3. x = 5, x = -5
4. x = 4, x = -8
5. 8 and 9
